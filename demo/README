	README          - this file
	Makefile        - Makefile of this directory
	demo.csh        - shell script: a demonstration tour around VCG
	demo.csh.tpl    - template for this shell script. This template
			  is used to generate demo.csh.

     used by demo.csh:

	vcgcount.c      - count number of nodes and and edges in a graph.
			  It reads from stdin. 
	vcgcount        - the corresponding binary
	animation1.c    - example of an animation
	animation1      - the corresponding binary
	animation2.c    - a second example of an animation
	animation2      - the corresponding binary
	animation3.c    - a third example of an animation
	animation3      - the corresponding binary
	vcgdemomaker.c  - utility to produce demo specifications for VCG
	vcgdemomaker    - the corresponding binary

     The VCG tool does not contain a direct printer driver except 
     PostScript (because there are many different types of printers in the 
     world). Instead, the export into the PBM-format is possible. For the 
     PBM-format, there exist a lot of printer drivers in the world.

	pbmrot90.c   - utility to rotate a PBM-P4-output 
	pbmrot90     - the corresponding binary
	pbmshift.c   - utility to create margins at PBM-P4-outputs
	pbmshift     - the corresponding binary
	pbm2hp.c     - utility to print a PBM-P4-output on a HP LaserJet.
		       This is an example of a PBM printer driver.
	pbm2hp       - the corresponding binary


When we do "make install", not all these tools are useful to be installed.
Some are only demo sources.  We install the following tools:

	vcgdemomaker, pbmrot90, pbmshift, pbm2hp
