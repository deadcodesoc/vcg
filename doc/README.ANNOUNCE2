          Announcement: New version of the VCG tool
--------------------------------------------------------------------
     

			The VCG Tool 
			============
	   A Visualization Tool for compiler graphs


DESCRIPTION
     The VCG tool reads a textual and readable specification of a 
     graph and visualizes  the graph.   If  not  all positions of 
     nodes are fixed,  the tool  layouts the graph using  several 
     heuristics as reducing  the number of crossings,  minimizing 
     the  size of  edges,  centering of nodes.  The specification 
     language of  the  VCG  tool is nearly compatible to GRL, the 
     language of the edge tool, but contains many extensions. The 
     VCG tool  allows folding of dynamically or statically speci-
     fied  regions  of the  graph.  It uses  colors and  runs  on 
     Sunview or X11.

     The VCG tool has been developed and tested on a Sparc ELC with
     SunOs 4.1.3, Sunview and X11 Release 4, Release 5 and Release 6, 
     and different ANSI C and K&R C compilers. It has further been 
     tested on a Silicon Graphics (IRIX 4.0.5), on a IBM R6000 (AIX 2 
     with AIX Windows), on a HP-UX (cc and c89) and on Linux (X11R5, 
     gcc).


WHAT IS NEW
     1) Several bugs are solved now. Thanks to all people who have
	reported these.

     2) The usage of the X11 version of the tool is improved:
	Scrollbars for positioning and scaling, dialog boxes for the
	selection of layout parameters and for the export to printer
	formats, a speedup of the drawing routines, etc.

     3) In the X11 version, PostScript output is available:
	Colored multiple page PostScript output up to 25 pages to 
        print very large graphs.

     4) Different shapes of nodes are available: boxes, triangles, 
        rhombs, ellipses.

     5) More possibilities to influence the layout of a graph:
	fixing the horizontal and vertical order of nodes, alignment
	of nodes.

     6) Edges can be drawn as splines.
	This is basically of interest for a high quality PostScript output,
	because the drawing of splines in a X11 window is rather slow.


FEATURES
     0) The VCG tool is not a graph editor. It is intended to
	visualize large graphs that are automatically generated by
	programs, e.g. debuggers of data structures.
     
     1) Speed is always the first priority. Examples:

	Type  | Nr.of nodes | Nr.of edges | Time     |  Mode   
        -------------------------------------------------------------
        tree  |  4095       |  4094       |  15 sec. | normal
	graph |    70       |   104       |   3 sec. | normal
	graph |    75       |  3983       |  89 sec. | -f (fast mode)

	The graph 3 with 75 specified nodes and 3983 edges consists of 
	21694 internal nodes and 23540 internal edge segments.

	The tests were done using a xvcg (X11 version, compiled by 
	gcc version 2.4.5, gcc options -O -finline-functions).
	They were done on a Sparc 10/30 (arch = sun4m) with 32 MB
	main memory. 
	The times include time for loading, layouting and displaying. 

     2) The layout algorithm can be controlled in different ways. 
	There are 11 basic layout methods and two variants of crossing 
	reduction.
	Further, the priorities of edges and the number of layout 
	iterations may be set to influence the layout.

     3) Folding of subgraphs, of dynamically specified regions and
	the hiding of classes of edges allow to select exactly the
	part of the graph that is of interest.	

     4) Arbitrary zooming of graphs.

     5) Color support.

     6) Export into PBM-P4 files (black and white) or PNM-P6 files
	(color). For these formats, there are a lot of converters
	and printer drivers in the world. (For instance, the PBM+ 
	package is available by anonymous ftp at ftp.cs.uni-sb.de 
	in the directory /pub/graphics).
	Export into multipage PostScript files is possible, too.

     7) Edges can be drawn as polygon segments, or as splines.

     8) Interface to program animations that provide the VCG tool
	with a sequence of graph descriptions.
 

FURTHER REMARKS
     I now have included a version number starting at V.1.0.
     Before, I had included a revision number, but this is
     not appropriate, because it is simply the number of the
     version control file of main.c.
     Okay: the last release was VCG, no version,  revision 3.4
     The newest release is      VCG, version 1.0, revision 3.9
     I hope nobody is confused by this.
