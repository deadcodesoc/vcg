INSTALLATION HINTS
------------------
	1) There is nothing to install. Thus, the Makefile is a dummy
	that makes nothing.  You can print the *.ps files
	on a PostScript printer, and read the other ASCII files. 

	2) We have included the PostScript version of the documentation.
	A LaTeX version does exist, too, but is not included, in order 
	to keep the package small.
	If you need the LaTeX version of the documentation, please
	contact  sander@cs.uni-sb.de

	3) Targets of the Makefile:

	   make               
	   make long        
	   make short         - Dummy targets. Not needed anymore.

	   make clean         - removes all temporary files.
	   make targetclean   - removes all temporary files.
	   make distclean     - removes everything that is not in the
				original distribution

	   make depend        - creates the dependencies
	   make dist          - creates a distribution
